## 📖 Overview

**Pingora Proxy Manager** is a next-generation reverse proxy solution designed for speed and reliability. It combines the raw performance of Rust and Cloudflare's Pingora framework with a beautiful, modern React dashboard.

Unlike traditional proxies, PPM supports **zero-downtime configuration reloading**, meaning your active connections are never dropped when you add hosts or change SSL settings.

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **⚡️ High Performance** | Powered by **Rust** & **Pingora** for ultra-low latency and high throughput. |
| **🔄 Zero-Downtime** | Dynamic architecture allows configuration changes without restarting the process. |
| **🔒 SSL Automation** | **HTTP-01** and **DNS-01 (Wildcard)** support via Let's Encrypt. |
| **🌐 Proxy Hosts** | Easy management of virtual hosts, path routing, and advanced rewriting. |
| **📡 L4 Streams** | **TCP/UDP** forwarding for databases, game servers, and other non-HTTP services. |
| **🛡️ Access Control** | Secure your services with IP Whitelists/Blacklists and Basic Authentication. |
| **📊 Real-time Stats** | Live traffic monitoring, status codes, and historical data visualization. |
| **🐳 Docker Ready** | Single-container deployment with a lightweight footprint. |

## 🚀 Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is using **Docker Compose**.

### 1. Create `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
services:
  pingora-proxy:
    image: dduldduck/pingora-proxy-manager:latest
    container_name: pingora-proxy
    restart: always
    network_mode: host # Recommended for performance & L4 streams
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data        # Database & Certs
      - ./letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt # Certbot account, renewal, and live cert state
      - ./logs:/app/logs        # Access Logs
    environment:
      - JWT_SECRET=changeme_in_production_please
      - RUST_LOG=info
```

> **Note**: We recommend `network_mode: host` for best performance and simplified port management. If you prefer bridge mode, ensure you map ports `80:8080`, `443:443`, and `81:81`.
>
> For Let's Encrypt, keep both `./data:/app/data` and `./letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt` mounted. HTTP-01 validation reaches PPM over host port 80, which the container forwards to the app's internal port 8080.

### Optional: If you run PPM behind another reverse proxy

If your traffic path is `Client -> Cloudflare/Nginx/ALB -> PPM`, set `PPM_TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS` (or `TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS`) to the IP(s) of the immediate proxy hop. Otherwise, PPM only trusts loopback for forwarded headers and may not use `X-Forwarded-For` / `X-Forwarded-Proto`.

Example:

```bash
PPM_TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS=127.0.0.1,10.0.0.10
```

### 2. Start the Service

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 3. Access Dashboard

Visit **http://localhost:81** (or your server IP) and log in:

*   **Username:** `admin`
*   **Password:** `changeme`

> ⚠️ **Important:** Please change your password immediately after logging in.

## 🛠️ Development

Want to contribute or build from source?

### Native Development
You can run the backend (Rust) and frontend (React/Vite) independently for faster iteration.

1.  **Backend**: `cd backend && cargo run` (Listens on 81 & 8080)
2.  **Frontend**: `cd frontend && npm run dev` (Proxies API to 81)

See the **[Development Setup](https://github.com/DDULDDUCK/pingora-proxy-manager/wiki/Development-Setup)** guide for details.
